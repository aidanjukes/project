            <div class="container px-4 px-lg-5">
                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                        <p>At first I doubted on whether I wanted to put this section in here. However, philosophy and my thoughts on life make up so much of what truly is me that I believe it would be injustice not to include this. Each and every person's thoughts on life and their perspective their on own existence affects so much of their decisions and their very potential in life.</p>
                        <p> Right now, I may just be a young single college student studying at BYU, but I am a firm believer that your circumstances really don't define you. Your circumstances don't make you happier nor do they make you who you are. It is your center and your very focus. Often when the center is good, it naturally attracts favorable circumstances. However, good or bad circumstances never constitute a good or bad core.</p>
                        <p>When I served my mission in Brazil I met some of the poorest people on earth. People who couldn't buy anything more than rice to feed their children. However these people were some of the most hard-working people I have ever known. They were only faced with circumstances much harder than my own.</p>
                        <p>That is only one example but I know that what truly defines a person is what's at their core. What they believe about themselves. What they believe about their purpose. What they believe about their duty to those around them. And what they believe about where joy is.</p>
                    
                        <h2 class="section-heading">So what do I believe?</h2>
                        <p> I believe that I truly am here for a reason. I am a religious man, which means that things I do now to me have a much greater eternal effect. So to me I believe things like honesty, knowledge, virtue, justice and service are the things that bring true joy. Those are the only things that are really in my control and are really the only things that are with me no matter what. So I believe my purpose here is to develop myself and to have joy in the process of doing so. </p>
                        <p>Now this does not mean that I do not persue anything else in life but rather that those things are of the most importance. I do dream of creating a family, owning a nice house, and having the finances to be able to see the world with them. However, none of that will mean anything if I do not develop myself. Aristotle said, </p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">"We are what we repeatedly do; Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit"</blockquote>
                        <p>This means that excellence will never be acheived in any one moment. I will not be excellent once I buy a house or travel the world. Excellence starts now and is a concious decision made everyday to be better and that... that is the real mission. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Okay, but why should anyone care about this?</h2>
                        <p>Now that is a very good question. Especially in hyper-capitalistic America where all people care about is how much they can produce in terms of work or money, or how much they can consume with their lusts and empty-pleasures, the idea of progression and self-development seems more and more like just good ideals that are neither pratical nor necessary.</p>
                        <p>But the irony is that the more you measure someone by their abilities in the moment, the less overall gain you will have in the long term. Because you will only ever have those capabilities and nothing more. You would have more gain in the long term if you focused more on progression rather than immediate results. So if we started to measure and focus more on how much people valued their own progression, their would be more success in businesses, governments, families and churches a like. Life has never been about where you are. It never will be either. Life rewards those based on where they are going. </p>
